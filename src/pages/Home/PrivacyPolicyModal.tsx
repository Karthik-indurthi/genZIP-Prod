        <p><strong>1. Introduction:</strong> This Privacy Policy is published by <strong>Serenique Technologies LLP</strong>, the legal entity operating the brand <strong>Gen-ZIP</strong>, a platform designed for verified in-person candidate interviews and fraud prevention.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Legal Entity Notice:</strong> All references to ‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äúour‚Äù, or ‚Äúus‚Äù in this document refer to <strong>Serenique Technologies LLP</strong>. All services and technology solutions offered under the name ‚ÄúGen-ZIP‚Äù are proprietary assets of Serenique Technologies LLP.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Scope:</strong> This policy applies to users interacting with Gen-ZIP services: Employers, HRs, Interviewers, Candidates, and GenZippers (field verification agents).</p>
       
        <p><strong>4. Consent:</strong> By using the platform, you expressly consent to the collection and usage of your data as outlined herein. You may revoke consent, but core services may become inaccessible.</p>

        <p><strong>5. Use of Data:</strong> Data is used to: (i) verify identity, (ii) match candidates and companies, (iii) conduct interviews, (iv) prevent fraud or impersonation, (v) assist legal authorities upon official request.</p>

        <p><strong>6. Data Retention:</strong> All media and text logs are retained for a minimum of 180 days for compliance and dispute resolution. Users may request deletion post this period if legal and functional obligations allow.</p>

        <p><strong>7. Disclosure:</strong> We do not sell or trade your personal data. We may share it with verified stakeholders (e.g., interviewer, HR of the same company, GenZipper assigned) and legal authorities when legally obligated.</p>

        <p><strong>8. Video and Audio Data:</strong> Interviews are recorded in-person. These recordings are stored in encrypted form and are accessible only to the company‚Äôs HR and interviewer panel. Unauthorized distribution is prohibited.</p>

        <p><strong>9. Third-Party Services:</strong> We use services like Twilio (for calls, OTP), Stripe (for payments), and may use AWS/GCP for hosting. Each third-party vendor has its own privacy and compliance policies.</p>

        <p><strong>10. Candidate Responsibility:</strong> If a candidate engages in impersonation, location spoofing, or provides forged documents, Gen-ZIP reserves the right to blacklist the individual and initiate legal action under IPC Sections 417, 420, and the IT Act 66D.</p>

        <p><strong>11. HR & Company Misconduct:</strong> Uploading fake interview schedules, ghosting candidates, or exploiting the platform for non-legitimate recruitment may lead to account suspension, public blacklisting, and termination of paid services without refund.</p>

        <p><strong>12. GenZipper Conduct:</strong> Field agents are expected to maintain professionalism, confidentiality, and real-time check-ins. Misuse of power, harassment, or recording outside the scope will lead to criminal prosecution and internal blacklisting.</p>

        <p><strong>13. Security:</strong> All data is encrypted (AES-256 standard). Only authorized role-based access is allowed. Internal audits are performed quarterly. Breach incidents, if any, will be notified under CERT-IN guidelines.</p>

        <p><strong>14. Payment Security:</strong> Stripe handles card details; Gen-ZIP never stores or processes raw card numbers. Refunds are processed per our <i>Refund Policy</i>, typically within 5‚Äì7 business days of request.</p>

        <p><strong>15. Legal Compliance:</strong> We adhere to Indian laws (IT Act 2000, Personal Data Protection Bill drafts) and adopt certain GDPR principles voluntarily. Jurisdiction lies with Hyderabad courts.</p>

        <p><strong>16. Minors:</strong> This platform is strictly for users aged 18 and above. If a minor is found using our services, we will delete their data immediately upon verification.</p>
        <p><strong>17. Information We Collect:</strong> We collect identification details (name, contact, government ID), biometric identifiers (photos, video), device data, IP logs, interview metadata, payment history, and location data (for GenZippers).</p>

        <p><strong>18. Limitation of Liability:</strong> Gen-ZIP shall not be held liable for damages arising from user negligence, third-party data leaks, or use of platform data outside intended scope. Users agree to indemnify Gen-ZIP in such cases.</p>

        <p><strong>19. Changes to This Policy:</strong> We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected with a new date, and continued use of the service implies acceptance.</p>
